# Computational Data Analysis

## Description:
Course includes hands-on introduction to programming techniques relevant to data analysis and machine learning. Most of the programming exercises are based on Python and SQL.

Notebooks are built "from scratch," of the basic components of a data analysis pipeline: collection, preprocessing, storage, analysis, and visualization. There are several examples of high-level data analysis questions, concepts and techniques for formalizing those questions into mathematical or computational tasks, and methods for translating those tasks into code. Beyond programming and best practices, notebooks include elementary data processing algorithms, notions of program correctness and efficiency, and numerical methods for linear
algebra and mathematical optimization.
